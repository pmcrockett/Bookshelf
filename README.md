# Bookshelf
JavaScript library program that stores information about books entered by the user.

Click book titles to expand them and view details. Book data can be edited with the pencil button or deleted with the trash can button. Any fields that aren't filled are automatically omitted from the expanded book display.

The bookshelf can be sorted with the buttons on the sidebar.
